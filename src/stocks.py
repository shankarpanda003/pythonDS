# Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days,
# the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed.
# Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
#
# Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
#
# Examples:
#
# Input: prices[] = {7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2}
# Output: 8
# Explanation: Buy for price 1 and sell for price 9.
#
# Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1}
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Since the array is sorted in decreasing order, 0 profit can be made without making any transaction.
#
# Input: prices[] = {1, 3, 6, 9, 11}
# Output: 10
# Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1]
